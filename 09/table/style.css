/* A table-layout value of fixed is generally a good idea to set on your table, as it makes the table behave a bit more predictably by default. Normally, table columns tend to be sized according to how much content they contain, which produces some strange results. With table-layout: fixed, you can size your columns according to the width of their headings, and then deal with their content as appropriate.  */
